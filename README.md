# ECE 472: Deep Learning 
We learn Deeply. 

# Assigments: 
- 01: Linear Regression of Sinewave with Gaussian Basis Functions <br>
Perform linear regression of a noisy sinewave using a set of gaussian basis functions with learned location and scale parameters. Model parameters are learned with stochastic gradient descent. Use of automatic differentiation is required.
- 02: Spiral Classification with Multi-Layer Perceptron <br>
Perform binary classification on the spirals dataset using a multi-layer perceptron. You must generate the data yourself.
- 03: : MNIST Classification <br>
Classify MNIST digits with a (optionally convoultional) neural network. Get at least 95.5% accuracy on the test test. Challenge: 80% accuracy, with fewest number of learned parameters
- 04: CIFAR 10/100 <br>
Classify CIFAR10. Acheive performance similar to the state of the art. Classify CIFAR100. Achieve a top-5 accuracy of 90%.
- 05: Classify the AG News dataset <br>
Consider the AG News dataset. which contains headlines and descriptions for a large set of news articles. Perform proper cross validation.
